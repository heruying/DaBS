## Daniel's Blogging System
### An static page generator created in Python to be used for blogs

*Reinventing the wheel just for the fun of it*

**Current version: 0p.0.0**

Versionining explanation: 

- First value = Development cycle (*x*) and stage (*p* for pre-alpha, *a* for alpha, *b* for beta and *s* for stable release) 

- Second value = Number of added features in development cycle

- Third value = Bug correction


## How are posts written?

With Markdown. Hah. I'll not invent some new markup language for this. I'll just implement the `https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/`BUT I'll add someway of adding metadata (probably just some enclosing symbols that will delimit what will not be transpiled to HTML and then use a conventional "tag: value")

## Additional information

Initially my idea is to create everything without the use of external tools or libraries, this may change with time depending on need.
