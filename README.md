## Daniel's Blogging System
### An static page generator created in Python to be used for blogs

*Reinventing the wheel just for the fun of it*

**Current version: 0p.0.0**
Versionining explanation: 
	- First value = Development cycle (*x*) and stage (*p* for pre-alpha, *a* for alpha, *b* for beta and *s* for stable release) 
	- Second value = Number of added features in development cycle
	- Third value = Bug correction
